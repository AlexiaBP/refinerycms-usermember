# Refinery CMS Members

Simple member engine for [Refinery CMS](http://refinerycms.com). It supports member management and page privilege setting.

This version of `refinerycms-members` supports Rails 3.2.x, development for RefineryCMS 2.0 and above.

## Install

Open up your `Gemfile` and add:

    gem 'refinerycms-members'

Run `bundle install`

Next, to install the members plugin run:

    rails generate refinery:members

Note that the above task copies `*.refinery_members.rb` migration files to your `db/migrate` directory.
You should examine `*_create_members.refinery_members.rb` file and adjust it (if necessary)
to enable or disable Devise strategies and options that are appropriate for your flavor of members.

**WARNING**: Rails 3 has a bug (fixed in Rails 4) which causes `rake railties:install:migrations`
to copy engine migration files without a particular order. Since `refinerycms-members`
depends on the database table generated by `refinerycms-pages`, the migrations may be copied
in a wrong order and thus will not run. Either start your project without `refinerycms-members`
and add this gem later, or rename `*.refinery_members.rb` migrations to follow
`*_create_pages.refinery_pages.rb` migration before running `rake db:migrate` for the first time.

Finally migrate your database and you're done.

    rake db:migrate

## How to build this engine as a gem

    gem build refinerycms-members.gemspec
    gem install refinerycms-members.gem
    
    # Sign up for a http://rubygems.org/ account and publish the gem
    gem push refinerycms-members.gem
